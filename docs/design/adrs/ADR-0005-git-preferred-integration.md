# ADR-0005 - Git Preferred Integration

Status:
Accepted

Context:

While version control is optional, OT benefits from integrating with available source control systems.

Git has the highest expected usage among OT users.

Mercurial support is desirable but secondary.

Decision:

Recognized version control systems shall be prioritized in the following order:

1. Git
2. No version control
3. Mercurial
4. Other supported systems

Git integration should receive the greatest implementation effort.

Reasoning:

Git provides:

- User identity
- Email configuration
- Editor configuration
- Repository root detection
- Merge and rebase safety information

Most users are expected to use Git.

Alternatives Considered:

### Git Only

Pros:

- Simpler implementation

Cons:

- Excludes valid users

### Equal Support For All Systems

Pros:

- Broad compatibility

Cons:

- Significant implementation effort
- Complex testing requirements
- Unnecessary for early versions

Consequences:

Positive:

- Strong Git experience
- Future Mercurial support remains possible
- Core architecture remains version-control independent

Negative:

- Some integrations may behave differently across systems
- Additional abstraction layers may be required in the future
