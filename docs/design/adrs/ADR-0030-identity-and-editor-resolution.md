# ADR-0030 - Identity And Editor Resolution

Status:
Accepted

Context:

OT requires identity information for:

- Comments
- Meeting attendance
- Audit information

OT also requires an editor for interactive workflows.

Identity may originate from:

- OT configuration
- Git configuration
- Mercurial configuration
- Environment variables
- System defaults

Decision:

Identity and editor settings shall be resolved using a deterministic precedence chain.

Resolution order:

1. .ot/config.local.json
2. .ot/config.json
3. ~/.ot/config.json
4. Supported VCS commands
5. Environment variables
6. System defaults

Git and Mercurial configuration shall be obtained using VCS commands rather than direct file parsing.

Reasoning:

Users should have predictable control over configuration.

Using VCS commands delegates configuration discovery to the VCS implementation.

Alternatives Considered:

### Direct File Parsing

Pros:

- No subprocess execution

Cons:

- VCS-specific parsing logic
- Duplicate behavior

### Environment Variables First

Pros:

- Familiar to some users

Cons:

- Less predictable

Consequences:

Positive:

- Deterministic behavior
- Simpler maintenance
- Better VCS compatibility

Negative:

- Some configuration lookups require subprocess execution
