# Open Tasks (ot)

Open Tasks is a repository-native, database-free task and planning management tool designed for modern development workflows.

---

## Key Features

- **Repository-Native Storage**: All tasks, bugs, epics, and meeting notes are stored as Markdown documents with YAML frontmatter in `.ot/tasks/`.
- **Database-Free**: Everything is persisted directly in Git or your local filesystem.
- **UUID & Git-Style Short Identifiers**: Stable UUID-backed internal references with convenient, unambiguous short prefix identifiers for human interaction.
- **Direct File Editing**: Seamless round-trip editing via text editors or the CLI without loss of custom user sections.
- **Dependency & Hierarchy Graphs**: Unified WorkItem model supporting arbitrary parent/child nesting and bidirectional blocker/dependency tracking.
- **First-Class Validation & Repair**: `ot check` and `ot check --fix` for automatic detection and repair of configuration and filesystem inconsistencies.

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install the standalone executable launcher:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://headhunter45.github.io/opentasks/install.sh | bash
```

Or download the latest standalone binary directly from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/headhunter45/opentasks/releases/latest).

### Repository Workflow

Open Tasks self-hosts its own task tracking directly within this repository using the `./otw` project wrapper:

```bash
# Verify project version & integrity
./otw version
./otw check

# Query the active backlog
./otw task list

# Create a new feature task
./otw task create --title "My New Feature" --type feature --size medium

# Progress a task's status
./otw task status "My New Feature" in_progress
```

### Running Unit Tests

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```
